# Intro to Onshape

## Introduction

Before you get started with Onshape, it's useful to understand the whats and whys of CAD, or Computer Aided Design. Popular software include Solidworks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, and of course, Onshape. The reason our team uses Onshape is due to its accessibility. CAD allows the user to create detailed digital models so you can easily design, test, and iterate almost anything.

Pros of using Onshape:

* First, Onshape can be **used directly from your browser**, so it's much more accessible than other CAD programs that require a dedicated installation. 
* Second, Onshape is **completely free**; other software is often very expensive. 
* Third, Onshape allows you to share your projects, so that **multiple people can work on the same project at once.** Most other softwares don’t have this feature.

Cons of using Onshape:
* There are several features unavailable via Onshape that would us during our design, prototyping, or building process, such as stress testing, which would help us determine the center of gravity to maximize weight distribution.
