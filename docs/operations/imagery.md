# Imagery

Welcome to the Imagery section of the Operations Department! Imagery changes every year with new designs, but this BobaDocs page will only consist of the branding standards and images of the boba brand created in 2018.

Standards for branding are crucial for creating a recognizable brand and promoting our team. These branding standards are established in order to help unify the team image, provide consistency to team merchandise and materials, and build recognition among other FRC teams and our surrounding community. In addition, we hope that our brand will inspire our students to show spirit for our team. 

Our brand focuses on a playful and passionate image. Our colors are bright and vibrant, and team imagery emphasizes hand-drawn, simple designs that convey a lighthearted energy. When used appropriately, our standards and guidelines allow for professionalism while retaining the spirit of our team. 

Due to the importance of a consistent brand, the team brand cannot be majorly changed without the agreement of team leadership.
